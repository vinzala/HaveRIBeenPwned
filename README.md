Have RI Been Pwned?

The state of Rhode Island is the epicenter of a unique regional dialect. From colloquialisms (eg. "bubbler == drinking fountain"); to uniquely named cuisine (eg. "saugys", "quahogs") and geography (eg. "Weekapaug", "Misquamicut"), this tiny state is host to a prolific lexicon of it's very own.

Given the distinct linguistic fabric of the region, it is possible to identify compromised passwords likely to have been used by people who have some connection to the area. Additionally, the development of dictionaries or word-lists containing examples of local dialect may prove to be useful for local security practitioners.

These files contain locally themed strings found in a plaintext collection of 496,803,513 compromised passwords. This aggregated set of credentials was compiled by cracking the hashed passwords found within the HaveiBeenPwned data set (source: hashes.org). The data presented here is by no means comprehensive, and represents only a simple proof-of-concept intended to demonstrate that these unique words have appeared in real passwords. The methodology consisted of nothing more than simple case-insensitive grep string searches. The crude script that was used has been included in this publication, for the sake of methodological transparency. However, this script is inefficient and generally unsuitable for working with such large data sets. 


Notes on Entomology: 
Many of the words associated with the area are derived from the Narragansett language. Interestingly, while some of these words have been widely adopted by the English language (eg. "squash", "pow wow", "moose"); others have remained common parlance only within a regionally limited area (eg. "quahog"). Furthermore, other words are only ever used to refer to specific geographic locations, giving even some of the most obscure spots in RI names which are distinctly unique (eg. "Usquepaug", "Quonochontaug"). 

The Narragansett language, and many of the words one may encounter within the region, owe their continuity of use to the work of Roger Williams. The state's founder authored a book entitled 'A Key into the Language of America' (1643), in which he documented the language of the native peoples whom inhabited the area which would become the State of RI.
